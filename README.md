# Human-Activity-Recognition

## About the DATASET ...

### Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0)
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

#### For each record it is provided:
==================================
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

#### About Features:
==================
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Problem Framework

30 subjects(volunteers) data is randomly split to 70%(21) test and 30%(7) train data.
Each datapoint corresponds one of the 6 Activities.
1. Walking
2. WalkingUpstairs
3. WalkingDownstairs
4. Standing
5. Sitting
6. Lying.

#### Problem Statement
Given a new datapoint we have to predict the Activity

#### Data Cleaning
There is no Duplicate Values in train and test dataset
There is no missing values in this dataset.
Train & Test data is almost balanced.

![Train Dataset Distribution](/Visualization/train_dist.png)
![Test Dataset Distribution](/Visualization/test_dist.png)

##### Data Provided by each subject

![Countplot (Training set)](/Visualization/countplot.png)

#### 1. Featuring Engineering from Domain Knowledge
#### Static and Dynamic Activities

In static activities (sit, stand, lie down) motion information will not be very useful.
In the dynamic activities (Walking, WalkingUpstairs,WalkingDownstairs) motion info will be significant.

#### 2. Stationary and Moving activities are completely different

![Activities](/Visualization/staticvsdynamic.png)
As we can clearly see the difference between stationary activities and Moving Activities as per above pdf distribution.

##### Magnitude of Accelaration can also separate Activities
![Activities](/Visualization/boxtbody.png)
![Activities](/Visualization/boxfbody.png)

###### Observations:

1. If tAccMean is < -0.8 then the Activities are either Standing or Sitting or Laying.
2. If tAccMean is > -0.6 then the Activities are either Walking or WalkingDownstairs or WalkingUpstairs.
3. If tAccMean > 0.0 then the Activity is WalkingDownstairs.
4. We can classify 75% the Acitivity labels with some errors.

##### Position of GravityAccelerationComponants

To understand variation of Gravity Accelaration Components, 3D plot will be easier to interpret as every Smartphone sensors works in 3-Dimensional Plane.

###### Observations:

1. If angleX,gravityMean > 0 then Activity is Laying.
2. We can classify all datapoints belonging to Laying activity with just a single if else statement.


## Model Selection

In model selection phase, I have train the data into multiple classifier Algorithms. Classifier algorithm are as follows :
1. KNeighborsClassifier
2. SVC
3. Decision-Tree Classifier
4. Random-Forest Classifier
5. GaussianNB
6. Ridge Classifier
7. Logistic Regression

###### Observation

Score: 95.7% 	 Classifier: KNeighborsClassifier\
Score: 98.1% 	 Classifier: SVC\
Score: 94.1% 	 Classifier: DecisionTreeClassifier\
Score: 98.1% 	 Classifier: RandomForestClassifier\
Score: 72.7% 	 Classifier: GaussianNB\
Score: 98.4% 	 Classifier: RidgeClassifier\
Score: 98.9% 	 Classifier: LogisticRegression\


Next I used **Stacking Classifier** because, Stacked generalization consists in stacking the output of individual estimator and use a classifier to compute the final prediction. Stacking allows to use the strength of each individual estimator by using their output as input of a final estimator.

```python
estimators = [
        ('RFC' ,RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, random_state = 42)),
        ('KNC', KNeighborsClassifier(5)),
        ('DTC', DecisionTreeClassifier()),
        ('SVC', SVC(kernel="rbf")),
        ('RC',  RidgeClassifier()),
]

clf = StackingClassifier(
    estimators=estimators,
    final_estimator=GradientBoostingClassifier()
)
```

#### Model Performance: (Observations)

![AUROC Curve Training](/Visualization/trainAUC.png)
![AUROC Curve Testing](/Visualization/testAUC.png)

We got very good Accuracy in multilabel classification by stacking the classifiers.

1. Accuracy for Train data before feature selection\
Score: 98.9%\
2. Accuracy for Original Test data before feature selection\

## Feature Selection

There are 561 features, I experimented with most important features and also used Advanced Dimensionality Reduction (**UMAP, T-SNE, PCA**)

I used Random-Forest Classifier as the model to select important Features .

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier


def featureSelection():
    train = pd.read_csv("Human Activity Recognition with Smartphone/train.csv")
    x = train.drop(['subject', 'Activity'], axis=1)
    y = train['Activity']

    selectFeature = SelectFromModel(RandomForestClassifier())
    selectFeature.fit(x, y)

    features1 = x.columns[(selectFeature.get_support())]
    return features1
```

###### Observations

## Dimensionality Reduction for selecting features
The main idea behind redusing dimensions is to reduce all 561 features to n number of components, so that every feature could have their importance in model, rather than only using the selected features.

And also the model will train fast if we reduce the features.
I have used 3 Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm:

1. **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)
2. **T-SNE** (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
3. **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

#### Visualizing algorithms for this dataset:
## PCA
![PCA](/Visualization/PCA.png)
## T-SNE
![T-SNE](/Visualization/T-SNE.png)
## UMAP
![UMAP](/Visualization/UMAP(Supervised).png)

UMAP performs better than PCA and T-SNE for this dataset, so we can transform our dataset according to the input of UMAP model. And then train the **Stacked Classifier** with the transformed data.

```python
import umap.umap_ as umap
trans = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=5, n_components=5 ,random_state=42).fit(x_train)
clf.fit(trans.embedding_,y_train)
test_embedding = trans.transform(x_test)
y_pred = clf.predict(test_embedding)
f1 = f1_score(y_true=y_test,y_pred=y_pred,average="macro")
print(f"Score: {round(f1, 3) * 100}%")
```

###### Observation:

umap training   Score: 92.0%\
umap test       Score: 85.9%\
